x = 10: This line assigns the value 10 to the variable x.
print(x): This line prints the value of x, which is 10.
print(type(x)): This line prints the data type of x, which is int for integer.
print(float(x)): This line converts x to a float data type and then prints its value. In this case, it prints 10.0.
print(int(x)): This line converts x to an int data type and then prints its value. Since x is already an integer, this just prints its value 10.
print(type(str(x))): This line converts x to a str (string) data type and then prints its data type. The output should be <class 'str'>.
